**Project Overview**

This is a microservice-based Kubernetes and Docker application designed to provide scalable and efficient services utilizing various technologies such as Elasticsearch, Redis for caching, and RabbitMQ as an event bus. The application comprises eight microservices, each serving a specific functionality:

0. **API Gateway Microservice**: Acts as a central entry point for client requests, directing traffic to appropriate microservices. Direct communication with other microservices is not allowed; instead, requests are routed through this gateway.
1. **Alert Microservice**: Responsible for alerting events and managing notifications.
2. **Auth Microservice**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
3. **Item Microservice**: Manages item-related operations such as CRUD operations.
4. **Msg Microservice**: Deals with messaging functionalities within the system.
5. **Order Microservice**: Handles order management and processing.
6. **Review Microservice**: Manages user reviews and ratings.
7. **Users Microservice**: Responsible for user management tasks such as registration and profile management.

**Technologies Utilized**

- **Kubernetes**: Utilized for container orchestration, allowing efficient deployment and scaling of microservices.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization, enabling consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Elasticsearch**: Employed for efficient search and indexing capabilities within the application.
- **Redis**: Utilized for caching purposes, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **RabbitMQ**: Acts as an event bus for asynchronous communication between microservices.

**Directory Structure**

The project directory structure follows a modular approach, with each microservice organized into its own directory under the `services` directory. Configuration files, Dockerfiles, and source code for each microservice are contained within their respective directories.

**Other Components**

- **Certificates**: Contains SSL certificates for secure communication.
- **Docker Volumes**: Holds persistent data volumes for Docker containers.
- **Kubernetes**: Includes YAML files for deploying microservices on a Kubernetes cluster.
- **SQL Scripts**: Contains initialization scripts for database setup.

Overall, this project is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and resilient, leveraging microservices architecture and modern containerization technologies to efficiently handle various functionalities of the application.
There are still some open issues and areas of improvement that need to be addressed...
